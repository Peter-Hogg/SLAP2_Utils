# SLAP2_Utils
[![Documentation](https://github.com/Peter-Hogg/SLAP2_Utils/actions/workflows/sphinx.yml/badge.svg)](https://peter-hogg.github.io/SLAP2_Utils/)
## Overview
The `SLAP2_Utils` library is designed to facilitate the reading of SLAP2 (Scanned Line Projection Microscopy version 2) binary files using Python. This utility aims to support researchers and developers working with data from SLAP2 two-photon microscopes by providing an interface to manipulate and analyze these files directly in Python as an alternative to a Matlab-based workflow. The SLAP2 microscope is a commercially available kit from MBF Bioscience (https://www.mbfbioscience.com/products/slap2). The detailed documentation can be found by clicking the documentation icon above `Overview`.

## Features
- **Reading SLAP2 Binary Files**: Convert SLAP2 proprietary binary data into accessible formats for Python.
- **Metadata Parsing**: Extract and utilize metadata associated with SLAP2 data files.
- **Data Manipulation**: Tools to manipulate and process data points read from the binary file.
- **Trace Extraction**: Tools to extract and generate traces from ROIs imaged in integrated scan mode.
- **MatLab-based Visual Stimulus**: Different kinds of visual stimuli, from checkers and moving bars to visual stimuli utilized by the Allen Institute, are ready to be imported for a SLAP2-related experiment.
- **Motion Corrections**: GPU-based tools that allows calculation of motion drifts, with x, y, z changes applied directly on the ROI inside the SLAP2 software (work in progress).
